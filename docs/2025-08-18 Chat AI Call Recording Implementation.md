# Chat AI Call Recording Implementation Log

Date: 2025-08-18 21:25:11 (UTC offset UTC−05:00)

## Plan
- Add a recorder utility to write chat request/response to `.obsidian/plugins/Vault-Bot/ai-calls/` with YAML header and JSON sections.
- Add a `recordApiCalls` boolean setting (default true) to settings UI with a privacy warning.
- Integrate recording in `CommandHandler.handleGetResponseBelow`: capture request start time, collect streamed response, compute duration, and write the file off the UI thread with retries.
- Use Windows-safe filenames, UTF-8 + LF, dynamic fence selection for JSON blocks.
- Keep failures non-fatal and logged.

## Viability Check
- Codebase already centralizes streaming via `CommandHandler` and provider wrapper; we can assemble the request/response from settings and the collected buffer.
- We can resolve the vault path using the Obsidian app adapter when present; fallback to a local `ai-calls` dir if not.
- No breaking API changes are needed; tests may need later updates for new setting defaults only if they assert exact equality (current tests don’t check that field).
- Node APIs (`fs`, `path`) are available in Obsidian plugins; atomic rename + retry is feasible.

Conclusion: Plan is viable with low risk.

## Execution Progress

1) Added `src/recorder.ts`:
- Exposes `recordChatCall()` that writes the YAML header, Request JSON, and Response JSON with dynamic fences.
- Handles Windows filename sanitization, LF normalization, and atomic write with retry/partial fallback.
- Provides `resolveAiCallsDir()` to locate the `ai-calls` directory under the vault.

2) Updated `src/settings.ts`:
- Introduced `recordApiCalls: boolean` in `VaultBotPluginSettings` and `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` (default true).
- Added a toggle in the settings UI with a clear privacy warning.

3) Updated `src/command_handler.ts`:
- Captures start timestamp, accumulates streamed response in a buffer, and after streaming calls `recordChatCall()` when enabled.
- Safely narrows provider-specific settings (model/system_prompt/temperature) for recording.
- Errors during recording are logged and non-fatal.

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests around `recordChatCall()` formatting and filename generation, plus a simple integration test simulating a write/rename failure.
- Add redaction utilities and tests to ensure no secrets leak in recordings.
- UI: optional indicator or notice when repeated recording failures occur, and a settings action to open/clear the `ai-calls` folder.

## Verification
- Build/Typecheck: Exercised via test compile (no TS errors).
- Tests: 8 files, 62 tests passed locally after changes, including new `tests/recorder.test.ts`.
- Smoke: Recording path resolves and a file is created; JSON blocks parse; YAML header present.

## Additional Implementation (redaction, robustness, UI)
- Redaction: Added `src/redaction.ts` with `redactText`/`redactMessages` and integrated into recording to mark `redacted: true` and sanitize messages.
- Tests: Added `tests/redaction.test.ts` (passes), enhanced `tests/recorder.test.ts` with collision and rename-failure cases (passes), updated `tests/settings.test.ts` for new folder actions.
- Settings UI: Added buttons to show the path of the AI calls folder and to clear recorded files, plus a simple error indicator line.

Re-run summary: Focused suites passed (12 tests). Full suite previously green (62 tests). All changes are backward-compatible and non-fatal on failure.
