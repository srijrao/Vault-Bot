# Get Response Above: spacing and selection fixes
Date: 2025-08-31 11:44:33 (UTC offset -05:00)

## Objective / Overview
Fix Get Response Above so it does not replace the selection and does not add an extra newline; rely on the configured chat separator for spacing. Keep Get Response Below behavior unchanged.

## Checklist
- [x] Locate existing command and handler
- [x] Design new behavior and contract
- [x] Implement command registration/handler changes
- [x] Implement handler changes in source file
- [x] Ensure separator/newline behavior is correct
- [x] Run static checks/tests
- [x] Update documentation/progress notes

## Plan
- Update `src/command_handler.ts`:
  - In directional conversation for 'above', insert only the configured separator (no extra \n prefix/suffix) and stream response before it.
  - In Get Response Above selection mode, do not call `replaceSelection`; instead, insert the separator at the selection start and stream the response before the separator, keeping user selection intact.
  - In separator-mode above, remove forced trailing "\n" from streamed response insertions.
- Keep Get Response Below as-is.
- Update tests in `tests/command_handler.test.ts` to match no-extra-newline behavior and selection-preserving approach.
- Build and run tests.

## Viability Check
- Risk: Adjusting spacing may affect expectations; covered by updating tests.
- Compatibility: Below flow unchanged; Above flow is additive and respects existing `chatSeparator`.
- Feasibility: Changes localized to `command_handler.ts` and tests; no external API changes.
- Edge cases: Empty separator, multi-line separators, multi-line responses, cursor in mid-line; tests already cover these areas.

## Implementation Progress
### Chronological Log
- 2025-08-31 11:38:17 Created planning doc entry and gathered timestamps.
- 2025-08-31 11:40:25 Implemented handler changes in `command_handler.ts` (Above: no selection replacement; no extra newlines).
- 2025-08-31 11:41:00 Built project; resolved type errors (none).
- 2025-08-31 11:42:58 Updated tests to reflect new behavior; ran full test suite.
- 2025-08-31 11:43:15 All tests passed (109/109).

### Files Changed
- src/command_handler.ts — Adjusted Above insertion logic and newline handling.
- tests/command_handler.test.ts — Updated expectations for newline and separator insertion.

### Notes
- Requirements coverage:
  - Do not replace selection for Get Response Above: Done.
  - Remove extra newline addition for Above: Done.
  - Keep Below identical: Done.
  - Document plan and progress: Done in this file.

## Result / Quality Gates
- Build: PASS
- Tests: PASS (109/109)
- Lint: N/A (no linter configured); Typecheck PASS via tsc step
- Status: Complete
