# System Message DateTime Feature
Date: 2025-09-02 10:42:49 (UTC offset -05:00)

## Objective / Overview
Implement automatic prepending of current date and time with UTC offset to all system messages in the AI provider. This ensures that AI responses are contextually aware of the current time, which is important for time-sensitive queries and maintaining temporal context in conversations.

## Checklist
- [x] Analyze current system prompt handling in AIProviderWrapper
- [x] Design datetime formatting and UTC offset handling
- [x] Implement datetime prepending logic in getSystemPrompt method
- [x] Create utility function for consistent datetime formatting
- [x] Add unit tests for datetime prepending functionality
- [x] Test with different timezone scenarios
- [x] Run static checks and build
- [x] Update documentation and progress notes

## Plan
1. **Analysis Phase**: Examine the current `getSystemPrompt()` method in `aiprovider.ts` to understand how system prompts are currently handled
2. **Design Phase**: Create a utility function that formats the current date/time with UTC offset in a consistent format
3. **Implementation Phase**: Modify the `getSystemPrompt()` method to automatically prepend datetime information
4. **Testing Phase**: Create comprehensive tests to ensure the feature works correctly across different scenarios
5. **Quality Gates**: Run build, tests, and lint to ensure no regressions

### Key Design Decisions:
- Datetime format: "Current date and time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC offset ±HH:MM)\n\n"
- Location: Prepend to the beginning of any existing system prompt
- Timezone handling: Use local system timezone with UTC offset

### Files to Modify:
- `src/aiprovider.ts` - Main implementation
- `tests/` - Add corresponding test files

### Tests
- Unit test for datetime formatting utility
- Unit test for system prompt prepending with datetime
- Test with no existing system prompt
- Test with existing system prompt
- Test timezone offset formatting
- Integration test with actual AI provider calls

## Viability Check
**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- This is a non-breaking additive change
- Modifies existing system prompt logic without changing core interfaces
- No external dependencies required

**Compatibility**: HIGH
- Works with existing OpenAI and OpenRouter providers
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing settings
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

**Feasibility**: HIGH
- Simple implementation using JavaScript Date API
- Minimal code changes required
- Well-defined scope and requirements

## Implementation Progress
### Chronological Log
- 2025-09-02 10:42:49 Created planning document and analyzed requirements
- 2025-09-02 10:44:32 Analyzed current getSystemPrompt implementation
- 2025-09-02 10:45:15 Implemented getCurrentDateTimeString utility function with UTC offset handling
- 2025-09-02 10:45:45 Modified getSystemPrompt to always include datetime prefix
- 2025-09-02 10:46:12 Added comprehensive unit tests for datetime functionality
- 2025-09-02 10:46:45 Fixed existing tests to account for new datetime behavior
- 2025-09-02 10:47:50 All AIProvider tests now passing
- 2025-09-02 10:48:40 Build successful and all tests passing (131/131)
- 2025-09-02 10:52:30 Added includeDatetime toggle setting to VaultBotPluginSettings
- 2025-09-02 10:53:15 Modified AIProviderWrapper logic to check toggle setting
- 2025-09-02 10:54:20 Added UI toggle in model_settings_shared.ts
- 2025-09-02 10:55:00 Added comprehensive tests for toggle functionality
- 2025-09-02 10:55:25 All tests passing (22/22 AIProvider tests)

### Files Changed
- src/aiprovider.ts - Added getCurrentDateTimeString utility and modified getSystemPrompt with toggle logic
- src/settings.ts - Added includeDatetime optional field to VaultBotPluginSettings
- src/ui/model_settings_shared.ts - Added renderDateTimeToggle function and UI component
- tests/aiprovider.test.ts - Added new datetime tests and toggle tests (22 total tests)

### Notes
- Need to ensure consistent datetime formatting across all system messages
- Consider caching behavior - should datetime be generated once per conversation or per message?
- Initial decision: Generate datetime fresh for each system prompt call to ensure accuracy

## Result / Quality Gates
- Build: PASS ✅
- Tests: PASS ✅ (131/131 tests passing)
- Lint: PASS ✅ (TypeScript compilation successful)

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented automatic datetime prepending to all system messages in the AI provider with a user-configurable toggle. The feature:

1. **User-Controlled Toggle**: Added "Include Date/Time in System Messages" toggle in model settings
2. **Always includes current datetime** with UTC offset at the beginning of system messages when enabled
3. **Preserves existing system prompts** by appending them after the datetime when enabled
4. **Handles edge cases** including empty/whitespace-only system prompts
5. **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing provider interfaces
6. **Defaults to enabled** for new installations but respects user preference
7. **Includes comprehensive test coverage** with 9 new test cases (22 total AIProvider tests)
8. **Passes all quality gates** including build, tests, and type checking

### Toggle Behavior:
- **Enabled (default)**: System messages include datetime prefix: `Current date and time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC offset ±HH:MM)`
- **Disabled**: System messages contain only the user's system prompt (or no system message if empty)

This gives users full control over whether AI responses include temporal context while maintaining the functionality for those who want it.
