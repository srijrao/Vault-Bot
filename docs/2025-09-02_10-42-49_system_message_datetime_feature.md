# System Message DateTime Feature
Date: 2025-09-02 10:42:49 (UTC offset -05:00)

## Objective / Overview
Implement automatic prepending of current date and time with UTC offset to all system messages in the AI provider. This ensures that AI responses are contextually aware of the current time, which is important for time-sensitive queries and maintaining temporal context in conversations.

## Checklist
- [x] Analyze current system prompt handling in AIProviderWrapper
- [x] Design datetime formatting and UTC offset handling
- [x] Implement datetime prepending logic in getSystemPrompt method
- [x] Create utility function for consistent datetime formatting
- [x] Add unit tests for datetime prepending functionality
- [x] Test with different timezone scenarios
- [x] Run static checks and build
- [x] Update documentation and progress notes

## Plan
1. **Analysis Phase**: Examine the current `getSystemPrompt()` method in `aiprovider.ts` to understand how system prompts are currently handled
2. **Design Phase**: Create a utility function that formats the current date/time with UTC offset in a consistent format
3. **Implementation Phase**: Modify the `getSystemPrompt()` method to automatically prepend datetime information
4. **Testing Phase**: Create comprehensive tests to ensure the feature works correctly across different scenarios
5. **Quality Gates**: Run build, tests, and lint to ensure no regressions

### Key Design Decisions:
- Datetime format: "Current date and time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC offset ±HH:MM)\n\n"
- Location: Prepend to the beginning of any existing system prompt
- Timezone handling: Use local system timezone with UTC offset

### Files to Modify:
- `src/aiprovider.ts` - Main implementation
- `tests/` - Add corresponding test files

### Tests
- Unit test for datetime formatting utility
- Unit test for system prompt prepending with datetime
- Test with no existing system prompt
- Test with existing system prompt
- Test timezone offset formatting
- Integration test with actual AI provider calls

## Viability Check
**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- This is a non-breaking additive change
- Modifies existing system prompt logic without changing core interfaces
- No external dependencies required

**Compatibility**: HIGH
- Works with existing OpenAI and OpenRouter providers
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing settings
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts

**Feasibility**: HIGH
- Simple implementation using JavaScript Date API

### API Call Recording Issue Discovery
- 2025-09-02 11:30:00 User discovered that archived API calls don't show actual system messages with datetime
- 2025-09-02 11:32:15 Identified bug: Recording system reconstructs messages from raw settings instead of capturing actual sent messages
- 2025-09-02 11:35:30 Analysis shows CommandHandler records `cfgAny.system_prompt` instead of processed `provider.getSystemPrompt()`
- 2025-09-02 11:40:00 Architectural issue: Recording happens downstream after AI call, should happen upstream during message construction

### API Call Recording Fix Implementation
- 2025-09-02 11:45:00 Made getSystemPrompt() public in AIProviderWrapper for recording access
- 2025-09-02 11:46:15 Updated CommandHandler recording logic to use provider.getSystemPrompt() instead of raw settings

- 2025-09-02 12:01:30 Modified getStreamingResponse and getStreamingResponseWithConversation to accept recording callbacks
- 2025-09-02 12:02:45 Implemented message capture at construction time in prependSystemPrompt flow
- 2025-09-02 12:04:00 Updated all CommandHandler functions to use upstream recording callbacks instead of downstream reconstruction
- 2025-09-02 12:05:15 Eliminated all raw settings reconstruction - now captures exact messages sent to AI providers
- 2025-09-02 12:06:30 Build successful and development server running with new upstream recording architecture

### Files Changed
- src/aiprovider.ts - Added getCurrentDateTimeString utility and modified getSystemPrompt with toggle logic; made getSystemPrompt public; added RecordingCallback type and upstream message capture
- src/settings.ts - Added includeDatetime optional field to VaultBotPluginSettings
- src/ui/model_settings_shared.ts - Added renderDateTimeToggle function and UI component
- src/command_handler.ts - Completely refactored API call recording to use upstream message capture instead of downstream reconstruction
- tests/aiprovider.test.ts - Added new datetime tests and toggle tests (22 total tests)

### Notes
- Need to ensure consistent datetime formatting across all system messages
- Consider caching behavior - should datetime be generated once per conversation or per message?
- Initial decision: Generate datetime fresh for each system prompt call to ensure accuracy
- **Critical Issue Discovered**: API call recording was reconstructing messages from settings instead of capturing actual sent messages
- **Architectural Fix**: Recording must happen upstream where actual messages are constructed, not downstream after API calls
- **Solution**: Use provider.getSystemPrompt() in recording logic to capture exact messages with datetime when enabled

## Result / Quality Gates
- Build: PASS ✅
- Tests: PASS ✅ (131/131 tests passing)
- Lint: PASS ✅ (TypeScript compilation successful)

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented automatic datetime prepending to all system messages in the AI provider with a user-configurable toggle. The feature:

1. **User-Controlled Toggle**: Added "Include Date/Time in System Messages" toggle in model settings
2. **Always includes current datetime** with UTC offset at the beginning of system messages when enabled
3. **Preserves existing system prompts** by appending them after the datetime when enabled
4. **Handles edge cases** including empty/whitespace-only system prompts
5. **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing provider interfaces
6. **Defaults to enabled** for new installations but respects user preference
7. **Includes comprehensive test coverage** with 9 new test cases (22 total AIProvider tests)
8. **Passes all quality gates** including build, tests, and type checking

### Toggle Behavior:
- **Enabled (default)**: System messages include datetime prefix: `Current date and time: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss (UTC offset ±HH:MM)`
- **Disabled**: System messages contain only the user's system prompt (or no system message if empty)

This gives users full control over whether AI responses include temporal context while maintaining the functionality for those who want it.

## API Call Recording Architecture Issue & Solution

### Problem Identified
The original API call recording system had a critical flaw: it was reconstructing messages from raw settings **after** the AI call completed, rather than capturing the **actual messages sent** to the AI provider. This meant:

- Recorded calls showed raw `system_prompt` from settings: `"You are a helpful assistant"`
- But actual AI calls included processed system messages: `"Current date and time: 2025-09-02 10:45:30 (UTC offset -05:00)\n\nYou are a helpful assistant"`
- The datetime toggle feature worked correctly, but archived calls didn't reflect what was actually sent

### Root Cause
Recording logic in `CommandHandler` was happening **downstream** after streaming completed:
```typescript
// WRONG: Reconstructing from settings
const systemPrompt = typeof cfgAny?.system_prompt === 'string' ? cfgAny.system_prompt : '';
```

But actual message construction happened **upstream** in `AIProviderWrapper.getSystemPrompt()`:
```typescript
// CORRECT: What actually gets sent to AI
public getSystemPrompt(): string | null {
    const settings = this.getProviderSettings();
    const basePrompt = settings?.system_prompt;
    
    if (settings?.includeDatetime !== false) {
        const datetime = this.getCurrentDateTimeString();
        return basePrompt ? `${datetime}\n\n${basePrompt}` : datetime;
    }
    
    return basePrompt || null;
}
```

### Solution Implemented
1. **Made `getSystemPrompt()` public** in `AIProviderWrapper` for recording access
2. **Updated all recording locations** in `CommandHandler` to use `provider.getSystemPrompt()` instead of raw settings
3. **Modified `buildConversationMessages()`** to accept provider parameter for proper system prompt handling
4. **Ensured recording captures exact messages** that were sent to AI providers

### Architectural Principle
**Recording should happen as close as possible to where actual messages are constructed**, not reconstructed downstream. This ensures recorded API calls match exactly what was sent to the AI provider, including all dynamic content like datetime prefixes.

### Next Phase: Proper Upstream Recording
~~The current fix resolves the immediate issue, but the ideal architecture would:~~
✅ **COMPLETED**: Proper upstream recording implemented!

1. ✅ **Capture messages at construction time** in `AIProviderWrapper.getStreamingResponseWithConversation()`
2. ✅ **Pass recording callback** to the provider methods via optional RecordingCallback parameter
3. ✅ **Eliminate reconstruction logic** entirely from `CommandHandler` - now uses captured messages
4. ✅ **Ensure 100% accuracy** between recorded calls and actual API requests

The new architecture captures the exact messages (including datetime when enabled) at the moment they are constructed and sent to the AI provider, ensuring perfect fidelity between what gets recorded and what actually gets sent to the API.
