# Rename Commands: Get Response Above/Below

Date: 2025-08-30 13:42:20

## Checklist
- [x] Analyze current command structure and identify changes needed
- [x] Update command names and IDs in `main.ts`
- [x] Update any references in tests or documentation
- [x] Run TypeScript checks
- [x] Run test suite
- [x] Update this document with implementation progress

## Plan
- Rename the existing "Get Response" command to "Get Response Below" (id: `get-response-below`) to clarify that it inserts responses after the selection
- Keep the new "Get Response (Insert Above)" command as "Get Response Above" (id: `get-response-above`) 
- This provides clear distinction: 
  - "Get Response Below" = original behavior (insert after selection)
  - "Get Response Above" = new behavior (insert before selection, with separator-mode support)
- Update command registration in `main.ts`
- Verify no breaking changes to existing functionality
- Update tests if they reference command names/IDs

## Viability Check
- ✅ Simple rename operation - low risk
- ✅ Existing `handleGetResponseBelow` method can remain unchanged, just update command registration
- ✅ New `handleGetResponseAbove` method already implemented
- ✅ Tests should continue to pass as they test method behavior, not command names
- ✅ No breaking API changes since these are internal command IDs

## Implementation Progress
- ✅ **COMPLETED** - Command renaming has been successfully implemented!

## Progress Log
- 2025-08-30 13:42:20 - Created this document and outlined plan
- 2025-08-30 13:45:01 - Updated command names and IDs in `main.ts`:
  - Changed "Get Response" (id: `get-response`) → "Get Response Below" (id: `get-response-below`)
  - Changed "Get Response (Insert Above)" (id: `get-response-above`) → "Get Response Above" (id: `get-response-above`)
- 2025-08-30 13:45:01 - Verified TypeScript compilation: ✅ No errors
- 2025-08-30 13:45:01 - Ran full test suite: ✅ All 69 tests passed
- 2025-08-30 13:45:01 - No breaking changes - existing functionality preserved

## Summary
Successfully renamed the commands to provide clearer distinction:
- **"Get Response Below"** - Original behavior that inserts AI responses after the current selection 
- **"Get Response Above"** - New behavior that inserts AI responses before the current selection (with separator-mode support)

The implementation is complete and all tests pass. The plugin now has two clearly named commands that make their behavior obvious to users.
