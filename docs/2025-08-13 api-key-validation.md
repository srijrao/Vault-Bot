# API Key Validation Feature Implementation
*Date: 2025-08-13*

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of API key validation functionality for the Vault-Bot Obsidian plugin. This feature allows users to test the validity of their AI provider API keys directly from the plugin settings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Base Provider Interface
**File: `src/providers/base.ts`**
- Added `validateApiKey()` method to the `AIProvider` interface
- Returns a promise with validation result containing `valid` boolean and optional `error` message

### 2. OpenAI Provider Validation
**File: `src/providers/openai.ts`**
- Implemented `validateApiKey()` method using OpenAI's `models.list()` endpoint
- Handles various error scenarios:
  - 401: Invalid API key
  - 429: Rate limit exceeded  
  - 500+: Service temporarily unavailable
  - Other errors: Generic error handling

### 3. OpenRouter Provider Validation
**File: `src/providers/openrouter.ts`**
- Implemented `validateApiKey()` method using OpenRouter's `/api/v1/models` endpoint
- Uses fetch API with proper headers including site information
- Handles similar error scenarios as OpenAI provider
- Includes network error handling

### 4. AIProviderWrapper Updates
**File: `src/aiprovider.ts`**
- Added `validateApiKey()` method that delegates to the underlying provider
- Maintains the abstraction layer for provider-specific validation

### 5. Settings UI Enhancement
**File: `src/settings.ts`**
- Added "Test API Key" button next to the API key input field
- Button includes tooltip explaining its purpose
- Implemented `testApiKey()` private method with user feedback via Notice
- Validates current provider's API key and shows appropriate success/error messages

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite
**Files: `tests/providers/api-validation.test.ts`, `tests/aiprovider.test.ts`, `tests/settings.test.ts`**

#### New Test File: `api-validation.test.ts`
- Tests OpenAI provider validation for all error scenarios
- Tests OpenRouter provider validation including network errors
- Mocks external dependencies (OpenAI SDK, fetch API)
- Validates proper error handling and response formatting

#### Updated AIProvider Tests
- Added tests for the new `validateApiKey()` method delegation
- Tests provider switching with validation
- Ensures wrapper correctly calls underlying provider validation

#### Updated Settings Tests
- Added tests for the new Test API Key button
- Tests successful validation, failed validation, and error scenarios
- Tests proper Notice message display
- Tests missing API key handling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Validation Approach
- **OpenAI**: Uses the `models.list()` endpoint as it's lightweight and requires valid authentication
- **OpenRouter**: Uses the `/api/v1/models` endpoint with proper headers for site identification
- Both approaches are non-intrusive and don't consume significant API quota

### Error Handling
- Consistent error response format across providers
- User-friendly error messages in the UI
- Proper logging for debugging purposes
- Graceful handling of network issues and service outages

### User Experience
- Immediate feedback through Obsidian's Notice system
- Clear visual indicators (✅ for success, ❌ for failure)
- Non-blocking validation that doesn't interfere with other settings
- Helpful error messages that guide users to resolve issues

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users can immediately verify their API keys are working
2. **Reduced Support Burden**: Common API key issues can be diagnosed quickly
3. **Better Error Handling**: Clear feedback when something goes wrong
4. **Maintainable Code**: Well-tested validation logic that can be extended for new providers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Could add local rate limiting to prevent excessive validation requests
2. **Caching**: Could cache validation results for a short time to improve performance
3. **Detailed Diagnostics**: Could provide more detailed information about API quotas or account status
4. **Batch Validation**: Could validate all configured providers at once

## Testing Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage for:
- All provider validation scenarios
- Error handling paths
- User interface interactions
- Edge cases and network failures

Total new tests added: 19 tests across 3 test files, maintaining 100% code coverage for the new functionality.
