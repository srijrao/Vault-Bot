# Implement: Insert AI response above selection

Checklist
- [x] Locate existing "Get Response" command and handler
- [x] Design "Insert Above" behavior and contract
- [x] Implement new command registration in `main.ts`
- [x] Implement handler `handleGetResponseAbove` in `src/command_handler.ts`
- [x] Ensure recording and redaction behavior preserved
- [x] Run quick static checks / tests
- [x] Append progress notes to this document

Plan
- Reuse the existing streaming insertion logic from `handleGetResponse`, but change the insertion point so the AI response is inserted above the user's selection instead of after it. Keep the selection replacement (query + separator) behavior the same so the user's text is still present.
- Implement a new command id `get-response-above` and wire it in `main.ts` to call `handleGetResponseAbove`.
- Implement recording and redaction the same as the existing handler.
- Add a secondary "separator-mode": when the document contains the configured `chatSeparator` immediately above a query line (including multi-line separators and common surrounding blank lines), treat the current line as the query and insert the AI response above the separator without duplicating it. This supports the pattern:

```
----
query
```

becoming

```
response
----
query
```

The implementation preserves streaming updates, abort handling, and optional recording/redaction.

Viability check
- The codebase already supports streaming updates and replacing ranges in the editor. Inserting above is a matter of choosing the right range to replace.
- Edge cases: multi-line selection, multiple rapid updates, abort handling. We'll mirror existing abort handling.

Implementation progress
- [x] Located existing command and handler (`main.ts`, `src/command_handler.ts`).
- [x] Implemented new command registration `get-response-above` in `main.ts`.
- [x] Implemented `handleGetResponseAbove` in `src/command_handler.ts` (selection mode and separator-mode).
- [x] Added robust multi-line separator detection (uses precomputed separator metrics and scans a small window of previous lines; trimmed comparisons tolerate surrounding whitespace).
- [x] Added unit test for separator-mode in `tests/command_handler.test.ts`.
- [x] Ran TypeScript compile check (`npx tsc --noEmit`) — no type errors.
- [x] Ran full test suite (`npm test --prefix <plugin-folder>`) and iterated until all tests passed.

Next steps
- Manual smoke test inside Obsidian recommended to validate UX in-editor (cursor, undo, large-stream handling).
- Consider additional unit tests for edge cases: separator at top-of-file, separator with only whitespace lines, empty separator behavior in separator-mode.
- Optional: expose a small user setting to toggle separator-mode behavior if you want explicit control.

Progress log
- 2025-08-26 21:14:02 - Created initial document and implemented the first pass of `handleGetResponseAbove` and command registration.
- 2025-08-26 21:15:10 - Ran `npx tsc --noEmit`: no type errors.
- 2025-08-26 21:XX:00 - Added separator-mode detection to support the `----\nquery` pattern and multi-line separators; implemented trimmed matching and windowed line scanning.
- 2025-08-26 22:59:56 - Attempted to run tests with pnpm; environment did not have `pnpm` installed.
- 2025-08-26 23:02:16 - Added a unit test `should detect separator-mode and insert response above a multi-line separator` in `tests/command_handler.test.ts` and iterated on detection logic to pass the test.
- 2025-08-26 23:13:25 - Ran full test suite with `npm test --prefix "c:\\Users\\Personal\\OneDrive\\Coding\\tester_vault\\.obsidian\\plugins\\Vault-Bot"` — all tests passed (9 files, 69 tests). Some tests emit expected stderr logs from provider mocks.

Checklist updates
- [x] Run quick static checks / tests

Files changed (high level)
- `src/command_handler.ts` — implemented `handleGetResponseAbove`, added separator-mode detection and multi-line separator support.
- `main.ts` — command registration (previously added): `get-response-above` wired to `handleGetResponseAbove`.
- `tests/command_handler.test.ts` — added unit test for separator-mode and added `getLine` mock usage.

Notes
- The new separator-mode detects the configured `chatSeparator` (including multi-line separators). It tolerates surrounding blank lines and uses trimmed comparisons to match the separator block, then inserts the AI response above the separator block. Streaming updates continue to replace the inserted response area while the provider streams chunks.
- Abort handling and optional recording/redaction remain unchanged.
- Manual verification in Obsidian is still recommended to confirm UX details.

How to run the checks locally
Run TypeScript check:

```powershell
npx tsc --noEmit -p "c:\\Users\\Personal\\OneDrive\\Coding\\tester_vault\\.obsidian\\plugins\\Vault-Bot\\tsconfig.json"
```

Run tests:

```powershell
npm test --prefix "c:\\Users\\Personal\\OneDrive\\Coding\\tester_vault\\.obsidian\\plugins\\Vault-Bot"
```

Completion
- The feature is implemented and unit-tested. All repository tests pass locally in this environment. Manual smoke testing in Obsidian is recommended as the final verification step.
