# Add AI Bot Configuration Modal and Workspace Side Panel
Date: 2025-08-31 10:01:40 (UTC offset -05:00)

## Objective / Overview
Add a shared modal component for basic AI bot configuration (API settings) that can be invoked from plugin settings, AND a dedicated workspace side panel for advanced model configuration (system prompt, temperature, model selection, etc.). The side panel should be accessible from workspace commands and focus on model tuning rather than basic setup.

## Checklist
- [x] Locate workspace command entry point for opening custom UI
- [x] Locate settings tab entry point for invoking modal
- [x] Design and define shared modal API (props, callbacks) 
- [x] Implement modal component in a common module
- [x] Integrate modal invocation in workspace context code
- [x] Integrate modal invocation in settings context code
- [x] Write unit tests for modal functionality and UI
- [x] Design workspace side panel for model settings
- [x] Implement side panel component with model configuration
- [x] Add workspace command to open side panel
- [x] Create side panel UI for: provider, model, system prompt, temperature
- [x] Write unit tests for side panel functionality
- [x] Update documentation and examples
- [x] Run static checks and tests

## Revised Plan
**Phase 1 - Basic Modal (COMPLETED):**
- ✅ Keep existing modal for basic API configuration in settings
- ✅ Modal handles: API provider, API key, recording settings, chat separator

**Phase 2 - Workspace Side Panel (NEW):**
- Create `AiBotSidePanel` class extending Obsidian's side panel functionality
- Panel focuses on model configuration: provider selection, model selection, system prompt textarea, temperature slider
- Add workspace command "Open AI Bot Panel" to toggle side panel
- Side panel should save settings in real-time like the modal
- Side panel should be accessible via ribbon icon and command palette

## Viability Check
- The Obsidian API supports modals via the `Modal` base class, so creating a shared modal module is straightforward.
- Both settings and workspace commands run in the same plugin context, so they can import and invoke the same code.
- Edge cases: no existing settings loaded, plugin version mismatches — will initialize with defaults.
- Risk: minimal, as modal code lives within plugin sandbox.

## Implementation Progress
### Chronological Log
- 2025-08-31 10:01:40 [Documented initial plan and checklist]
- 2025-08-31 10:03:04 [Implemented shared `AiBotConfigModal` in `src/prompt_modal.ts`]
- 2025-08-31 10:03:20 [Integrated modal open command in `main.ts`]
- 2025-08-31 10:03:40 [Added modal invocation button in `src/settings.ts`]
- 2025-08-31 10:08:00 [Created comprehensive unit tests in `tests/prompt_modal.test.ts`]
- 2025-08-31 10:10:15 [All prompt modal tests passing (10/10)]
- 2025-08-31 10:17:47 [Started implementing workspace side panel for model settings]
- 2025-08-31 10:19:15 [Completed side panel implementation in `src/side_panel.ts` with full model configuration UI]
- 2025-08-31 10:19:15 [Added workspace command "Open AI Bot Panel" and ribbon icon for quick access]
- 2025-08-31 10:35:55 [Added unit tests for side panel in `tests/side_panel.test.ts`]
- 2025-08-31 10:41:01 [Fixed `tests/settings.test.ts` obsidian mocks; tests now pass]
- 2025-08-31 10:44:00 [Full test suite passing (104/104); build verified]

### Files Changed
- docs/add-ai-bot-config-modal_2025-08-31_10-01-40.md
- src/prompt_modal.ts
- main.ts
- src/settings.ts
- src/side_panel.ts
- main.ts (updated with side panel registration)
- tests/side_panel.test.ts (new)
- tests/settings.test.ts (reworked mocks)

### Notes
- Shared modal opens from workspace commands and settings UI
- Modal: API provider, API key, recording settings, chat separator
- Side panel: provider, model, system prompt, temperature
- Settings persist via debounced save; provider-specific UIs render dynamically
- Tests cover modal, side panel, provider validation, archiving, recorder

### Usage Instructions
**Workspace Side Panel (Model Settings):**
1. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on Mac) and run "Open AI Bot Panel", or click the ribbon icon
2. Use the panel to change Provider, Model, System Prompt, and Temperature
3. Changes save automatically; no restart required

**Shared Config Modal (Basic Settings):**
1. Settings → Community Plugins → Vault-Bot → Settings
2. Click "Open Modal" in the "Configure AI Bot" section
3. Configure API Provider, API Key, Chat Separator, and Recording preferences

## Result / Quality Gates
- Build: PASS - TypeScript check + production bundle succeeded
- Tests: PASS - 104/104 passing (modal, side panel, providers, archive/recorder)
- Lint/Types: PASS - No new type or lint errors
