# Vault Bot

A versatile AI assistant plugin for Obsidian that enables seamless interaction with AI models directly within your notes.

## Features

- **Text Selection AI Response**: Highlight any text in your notes and get AI-powered responses instantly

## Commands

The plugin adds two commands to Obsidian:

- **Get Response**: Sends highlighted text to the AI and streams the response directly into your note
- **Stop Response**: Cancels an ongoing AI response generation

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Configure your API key and AI provider settings in the plugin settings tab
2. **Get AI Response**:
   - Highlight any text in your note
   - Use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P) and search for "Get Response"
   - Or assign a hotkey to the "Get Response" command
   - The AI will process your highlighted text and stream the response directly into your note
3. **Stop Response**: Use the "Stop Response" command to cancel an ongoing AI response

## Configuration

- **API Key**: Your OpenAI API key
- **API Provider**: Currently supports OpenAI (more providers coming soon)
- **Chat Separator**: The text used to separate your query from the AI response (default: `\n\n----\n\n`)
- **AI Provider Settings**:
  - **Model**: Choose your preferred OpenAI model (default: gpt-4o)
  - **System Prompt**: Customize the AI's behavior and personality
